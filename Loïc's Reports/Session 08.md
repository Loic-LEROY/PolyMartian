### Vertical rail

### Horizontal rails

## 3D modeling
### Ladybug
Now the main robot is almost physically complete, I started to model the ladybugs. These mini robots are designed to pollinate plants picked up within the first 100 seconds by the main robot. To validate this action, every ladybug must move from the departure base to a plant placement area and touch one of the plants.

For the modeling, I used the same process as for the main robot. I started by listing the items a ladybug should carry :
- A lidar
- A Raspberry Pi zero
- 2 motors
- A battery
- ...

Then I found on the internet the models of the Raspberry Pi zero and the lidar because they are standard items and it would be a waste of time to model them myself. I have an idea of the size of the motors and the battery we are going to use, so I modeled them myself. Now I have all the models of the main componants, I can start to design the chassis of the ladybug.
