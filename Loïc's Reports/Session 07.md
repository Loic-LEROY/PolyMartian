## 3D modeling
### Vertical rail mounting
In order to mount the vertical rails, I modeled on SolidWorks two pieces which will hold the rails in place. The first one avoid the rails to move vertically by blocking it at the bottom. It also blocks all the horyzontal translations. The piece is screwed to the base of the robot. The second piece blocks the rails from the rear and blocks the vertical translations thanks to a through screw. It is screwed to the top panel of the robot's frame. The two pieces are shown below in orange.

## 3D printing
### Vertical rail mounting
I printed the two pieces in PETG with a 0.2mm layer height and 50% infill. This settings are the best compromise between printing time and strength. The pieces are shown below in PrusaSlicer.
