## 3D Modeling
Last session, I started to model the system of freewheels or coding wheels which will be used to encode the position of the robot. During this session, I continued to model on SolidWorks the system by adding the mounts for the loaded springs. The design is very simple : I use compression springs made for 3D printer as they are very cheap and easy to find. The springs are mounted on a 3D printed part which is screwed on the robot. The spring is then compressed between the 3D printed part and the freewheel oscillating arm.

During this session, I also modeled the pivots for the motorized wheels. It is made with two rigid ball bearings, one on each side of the wheel. Bearings are mounted on 3D printed parts which are screwed on the robot. The bearings are clevis-mounted to maximize the regidity of the system.

You can't see it in this view, but the drive wheel, pulley and bearing inner rings are recessed on the pivot shaft.

To end this model, I modified the piece which holds the wheels so it also protects them from the sides. This feature will be useful in case our robot is hit by the opponent's robot.
