## 3D Modeling
Last session, I started to model the system of freewheels or coding wheels which will be used to encode the position of the robot. During this session, I continued to model on SolidWorks the system by adding the mounts for the loaded springs. The design is very simple : I use compression springs made for 3D printer as they are very cheap and easy to find. The springs are mounted on a 3D printed part which is screwed on the robot. The spring is then compressed between the 3D printed part and the freewheel oscillating arm.
