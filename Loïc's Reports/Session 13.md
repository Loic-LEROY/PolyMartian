## Ladybug
### Components
#### Ultrasonic sensors and camera
Last session, I ended up with this for the chassis of the Ladybug :

Today, I will continue to work on how the sensors will be placed on the chassis. I will start with the ultrasonic sensors and the camera. Because I want the robot to be as compact and as light as possible, I had the idea to use the servo motor as a support for the sensors. This way, I can use a small piece to attach the sensor to the servo. The bracket clips onto the servo motor. Here is the result :

Now, I can screw the ultrasonic sensor and the camera on the support.

#### Battery, Raspberry Pi pico W and BMS
The rest of the components are directly placed on the chassis.

#### DWM1001-DEV module
The DWM1001-DEV module is a bit particular because it has to be placed on the top of the robot, in the center, **vertically**. I had to design a specific support for it which is screwed on the chassis. The support is very simple, it is just an extruded T shape, held by to screws to the chassis. Here is the result :
