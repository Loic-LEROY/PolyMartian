## Hand made
During this session, I sewed the belts for the motorized wheels. The wire provides good tensile strength and the glue prevents the wire from loosening. I used a glue which remains soft after it dries so the assembly stays flexible.

After I finished making the two needed belts, I modified the robot frame to make the motors mounting holes oblong. This allows the motors to glide along the frame and adjust the belts tension. Then, I mounted the motors and the wheels with the belts to check if everything was working properly.
