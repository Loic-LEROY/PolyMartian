# Session report 16: April 9, 2024

**Session objective:** Switch from the Arduino Mega to an ESP32 on the robot. Etablish a connection between the Nvidia Jetson and the cameras. Optimize the closed loop control algorithm by setting a timer on the ESP32 to sample.

## Communication in USB between our cameras and the Nvidia Jetson
The first step to use our cameras on our robot was to etablish a connection between our four cameras and the Nvidia Jetson so we are able to send commands to the cameras to configure them and overall receive their processed data. As the Jetson has four usb ports, it was easier 

I then followed a tutorial written by Jevois, the manufactrer of our cameras : http://jevois.org/doc/USBserialLinux.html
To connect a camera to the Linux host provided on the Jetson using serial-over-USB, i first identified the device's port used by the camera with the command ```dmesg``` or ```lsusb```. Then i added permissions by adding my user profile to the dialout group with the command ```sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER$```. To avoid interference from the ModemManager program, which probes new serial devices, i also disabled the ModemManager  ```sudo killall ModemManager```. Then i was able to use serial communication with the application ```minicom``` (after installing it with ```pip install minicom```) and send configurations instructions to the camera.

## Problem with serial communication with ESP32
After successfully transfering a program to the ESP32, it was constantly rebooting as the following message was continously printed on the console : 

rst:0x8 (TG1WDT_SYS_RESET),boot:0x13 (SPI_FAST_FLASH_BOOT)
configsip: 0, SPIWP:0xee
clk_drv:0x00,q_drv:0x00,d_drv:0x00,cs0_drv:0x00,hd_drv:0x00,wp_drv:0x00

After some researchs i found out that on a classic ESP32 there are 6 pins which are used by internal Flash and thus musn't be connected to anything otherwise the chip will reboot indefinitely. The problem was simply solved by switching the cables on other pins, not used by internal flash, based on the following ESP32 Pinout diagramm made by uPesy :

## Test of an encoder with ESP32
Then I wired an Encoder to the ESP32 to verify it is still working as ESP32 works only with 3.3V signals so it may be incompatible with some numerical devices if they threashold is superior at 3.3V.

But hopefully communications between our encoder and the esp32 worked perfectly so it wasn't necessary to use a logic level shifting chip.

## Temporary wiring
Then i wired cables on the final version of our robot. This wiring is still temporary and will be used to do tests on the robot without waiting for all cables to be welded correctly. This will also prevent bad suprises, cause we will be sure that our wiring is correct before welding cables.

## Next session tasks
We have finally received all the components to be able to assemble the final version of the robot, so next session should be fully consacred to the calibration of the PID and optimizing the robot's displacements. Finally i will implement curved trajectories which will be necessary to avoid obstacles properly without loosing too much time.
