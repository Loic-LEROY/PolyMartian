# Session report 17: April 16, 2024

**Session objective:** Create the wiring robot's wiring diagram, wire cables on robots, add actuators.

## Wiring diagram
First, as during the competition we will probably need to do maintainance on the robot, to avoid loosing time with wiring, I created a wiring diagram on the software Fritzing.
This diagramm will also be used by Teo Baillot, a member of the team who is in charge of the cable management of the robot and will weld cables on the final version to avoid having cables unplugging on the robot during a match.
